# Rock Paper Scissors

## Description

Rock paper scissors game written using Javascript and HTML. The original version of this
project was console-based and utilised text input.

To play, the user selects either Rock, Paper, or Scissors. The computer will then also select Rock, Paper, or Scissors and the outcome of the game is output to the browser, with the score also updated.

One point is awarded to the winner based on the following rules:
Rock beats Scissors
Paper beats Rock
Scissors beats Paper

## Learning Outcomes
